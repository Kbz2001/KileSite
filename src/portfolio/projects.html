        This project was worked on during my time in a CSCE course at Texas A&M.
        Layne's Restaurant is a fast food chain that started in College Station, Texas.
        Our team (4 students) was tasked with designing a new POS system for this business.
        This project greatly emphasized project planning before any coding (GUI sketches and UML diagrams).
        <br><br>
        The Waterfall methodology was used throughout the duration of the project
        meaning that requirements were provided to our team through many stages.
        Our system provided managers with a way to track inventory as well as provide statistics on popular menu items.
        It also provided servers with an easy to use GUI for efficiently taking and tracking orders.
        <br><br>
        The backend was designed using Java along with a database for storing information.
        The frontend was designed using Java Swing which gave our team an easy way of making GUIs.

        This project was worked on during my time in a CSCE course at Texas A&M.
        Our team (4 students) was tasked with creating a solution using software to any problem we wanted to solve.
        The issue our team wanted to tackle was personal safety.

        The Agile methodology was used throughout the duration of the project
        meaning that the project was broken down into many tasks and these tasks were completed throughout a series of sprints.
        Our application provided users with many different avenues of personal safety including:

        <br><br>
        The backend was designed using Javascript and accessed different APIs to pull data from.
        The frontend was designed using ReactJS which made it easy for our application to be presentable on mobile

        This project was worked on as a final project in a CSCE course at Texas A&M.
        Our team (2 students) was tasked with created a solution to any problem we wanted to solve.
        One big restriction was the solution needed to be an embedded system (Hardware and software components).
        <br><br>
        Our project was a morse code translator which took input a series of morse noises and outputted the latin symbols.
        Input was done via a button.
        An LED matrix was used to display outputs one symbol at a time.
        Our program supported uppercase letters, numbers 0-9,
        and some extra symbols such as parentheses, exclamation point, and mathematical operators."
        <br><br>
        For me personally, it was the first time I've ever used both hardware and software to create a solution.
        Our software ran on a Raspberry Pi and the code was written in Python.
        On the hardware side, a breadboard was used to organize the many ICs that we choose to utilize.
        The final product was boxed into a 3D printed container specifically designed for our circuit.

        This project was worked on during my time in AI4ALL, an extracurricular program offered at Texas A&M.
        Our team (3 students) was tasked with creating a solution to any problem we wanted to solve.
        The only restriction was machine learning had to be used in the solution.
        <br><br>
        Our Problem: Doctors tend to be messy when it comes to writing notes on patients.
        These hard to read notes can slow down the process of helping patients.
        <br><br>
        Our solution was broken down into 3 stages:
        <br>
        1.) Translate handwritten notes to text
        <br>
        2.) Extract structured data from the unstructured text
        <br>
        3.) Allow easy visualization and exploration of the data
        <br><br>
        Due to time constraints we predicted that we wouldn't be able to complete the entire app due to how complex it was.
        Our top priority was implementing the part of our solution that used machine learning.
        We were able to get our first stage working, through the use of OCR (optical character recognition) which is a type of machine learning.
