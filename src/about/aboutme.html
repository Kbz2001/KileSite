                    I am currently attending Texas A&M University and working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.
                    Some of my hobbies include gaming, reading and programming.
                    In the past I combined my gaming and programming hobbies by modifying games and platforms that I played or used.
                    Through this process I have taught myself Java, Python, and some HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                    You can find more about the projects that I've done on the Projects Portfolio section.
                    My favorite subject in school has always been STEM related.
                    Whether it was math or science I always enjoyed those topics the best.

                            I also used Python in my extracurricular AI program that I was in.
                            The Python library used was TensorFlow which was a machine learning library.

                            I helped residences in the dorm halls (mostly new freshman) get settled in and made sure they were comfortable with the drastic change from high school to college.
                            I acted as a tutor as residents came to me for help on classes they struggled with.
                            I helped resident advisors (RAs) hold events for residents in the dorm halls.

                    One interest I have in computer science is quantum computing.
                    This field is very new in the world of technology.
                    As a result there isn't many opportunities to learn about it anywhere, especially in the academic world.
                    I have done minor exploring in my own time about quantum computing.
                    This interest is more of a hobby instead of a potential career choice just because the field is very new and there isn't a lot of opportunities in it.

                    I Participated in robotics during high school.
                    I worked on a team that did the First Tech Challenge.
                    This experience helped me apply what I was learning to solve a real engineering problem.
                    Through this extracurricular I reinforced my communication skills as it was necessary in order to work in a team setting.
                    Our team was further broken down into sub-teams to work on different aspects of our project such as software and hardware.

                    I find AI to be very interesting and think that it has a lot of future utility for society if used correctly.
                    I expanded on my knowledge in this field by participating in an extracurricular program that was offered at Texas A&M (AI4ALL).
                    It was an AI program where we got to learn about machine learning and eventually got to apply what we learned to a real world problem.
                    I will also take an elective course offered at Texas A&M during my senior year which is about artificial intelligence.
                    I can see a potential in this field as a career choice when i graduate college.
